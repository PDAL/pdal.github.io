The design, architecture, and implementation of PDAL is captured in this
set of Notes.  Each Note focues on a single major topic, such
as Use Cases, Pipeline Design, or Testing.  These Notes are intended to
capture design decisions, rationales, and points still to be decided.

Editorial comments, and points yet to be resolved, are noted in the text
**[like this]**.

The proper spelling of the project name is PDAL, in uppercase.  It is
pronounced to rhyme with "GDAL".
