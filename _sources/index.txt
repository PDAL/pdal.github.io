PDAL - Point Data Abstraction Library
******************************************************************************

PDAL is a `BSD licensed`_ library for translating and manipulating `point cloud
data`_ of various formats. It is a library that is analogous to the `GDAL`_
raster library.  PDAL is focussed on reading, writing, and translating point
cloud data from the ever-growing constellation of data formats.
While PDAL is not explicitly limited to working with `LiDAR`_ data formats, its
wide format coverage is in that domain.

PDAL is related to `Point Cloud Library (PCL)`_ in the sense that
both work with point data, but PDAL's niche is data translation and processing
pipelines, and PCL's is more in the algorithmic exploition domain. There is
cross over of both niches, however, and PDAL provides a user the ability to
exploit data using PCL's techniques. See :ref:`filters.pclblock` for more
background
