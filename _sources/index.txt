PDAL - Point Data Abstraction Library
******************************************************************************

PDAL is a `BSD licensed`_ library for translating and manipulating `point cloud
data`_ of various formats. It is a library that is analogous to the `GDAL`_
raster library.  PDAL is focussed on reading, writing, and translating point
cloud data from the ever-growing constellation of data formats that are being
developed for working with multi-dimensional emitted-pulse scanning systems.
While PDAL is not explicitly limited to working with `LiDAR`_ data formats, its
initial rollout is focused in that area.

PDAL is *not* related to `Point Cloud Library (PCL)`_ except in the sense that
both ostensibly work with point data. PDAL is for data format translation and
data access, with some light filtering and processing algorithms to streamline
those tasks. If you want a library that can do exploitation, visualization, and
sophisticated processing of point cloud data, you want PCL at
http://pointclouds.org.
